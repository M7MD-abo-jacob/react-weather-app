Hello there!
Thanks for checking this project
This is a test project, made for the purpose of trying out React Framework, functional components, API calls, animation and other modern features.
Different cities with different timezones (day/night) and different weater statuses (snow/rain/clear...) show different dynamic weather animations and styles.
It isn't perfect because of the lack of access to free APIs that are not restricted in my region, but I'm happy with what I've managed to achive, as the journey is what really matters to me.
